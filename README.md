# home-designer-app-Android
The main repository for files regarding the development of an AR-driven mobile app for furniture and object placement + modification.

This project is going to be developed using **Unity 3D** and most of the code will be composed of **C# -scripts** to modify assets and objects in Unity's scene view. The coding convention we're using is **CamelCase**. Visual Studio Code is our recommended code editor.

For Sprint 1 the plan is to have a working camera view with rudimental objects such as a cube or a triangle. The object will be selected from a menu view and the objects rendered using a camera scene.

The main repository for files regarding the development of an AR-driven mobile app for furniture and object placement + modification. Right now our focus is on developing the Android version of the application.

This project is going to be developed using **Unity 3D** and most of the code will be composed of **C# -scripts** to modify assets and objects in Unity's scene view. The coding convention we're using is **CamelCase**. Visual Studio Code is our preferred code editor.

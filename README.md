# home-designer-app-android
The main repository for files regarding the development of an AR-driven mobile app for furniture and object placement + modification. Right now our focus is on developing the Android version of the application.

This project is going to be developed using **Unity 3D** and most of the code will be composed of **C# -scripts** to modify assets and objects in Unity's scene view. The coding convention we're using is **CamelCase**. Visual Studio Code is our preferred code editor.

We are utilising Unity Asset Store assets and Chat GPT for the completion of this project.

## Installation
If you're interested in downloading the application on your Android device, you can find the latest downloadable version in the **Builds-folder.**

## Development Diary
For Sprint 1 the plan was to have a working camera view with rudimental objects such as a cube or a triangle. The object will be selected from a menu view and the objects rendered using a camera scene.
We managed to implement the camera view and had a working script for object rotation/size manipulation, but didn't yet implement a menu for multiple objects.

For Sprint 2 our focus has been on developing surface recognition and identification + user interface modification, so that the user can select from multiple different objects.
